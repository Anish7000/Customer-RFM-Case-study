# Customer-RFM-Case-study
Introduction
This project is a case study focused on conducting an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis using SQL. RFM is a well-known customer segmentation technique used in marketing and data analytics to identify valuable customers based on their purchasing behavior. This project is ideal for practicing SQL skills in a real-world business context.

 # Project Objective
- Calculate RFM Scores for Each Customer using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
- Segment Customers into categories like Champions, At Risk, and Lost using quantile-based RFM scoring.
- Identify Key Customer Metrics, including top spenders, most frequent buyers, and churned customers.
- Analyze Product and Revenue Trends such as top/bottom performing products and monthly revenue patterns.

# Dataset Used

# Question 
- Calculate RFM Scores for Each Customer 
- Top 10 Most Profitable Customers 
- Identify Churned Customers (No purchase in last 180 days)
- Segment Customers Based on Quantile RFM Scoring 
- Bottom 5 Selling Products by Quantit
- Group Customers by RFM Score into Segments (Champions, At Risk, etc.) 
- Top 5 products by revenue 
- Average Spend per Customer 
- Most frequent purchasing customers (Top 5 by invoice count) 
- Monthly revenue trend 

# SQL queries

# Project Outcome
- Successfully calculated individual RFM scores and built a composite RFM metric for each customer.
- Grouped customers into meaningful segments based on their behavior.
- Identified top 10 profitable customers, top 5 frequent buyers, and customers who churned.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used for customer segmentation through RFM analysis, a common business scenario in customer relationship management and marketing. Itâ€™s an excellent use case of how data analytics can directly drive business decisions and campaign strategies.
