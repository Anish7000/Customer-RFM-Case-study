# Customer-RFM-Case-study
Introduction
This project is a case study focused on conducting an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis using SQL. RFM is a well-known customer segmentation technique used in marketing and data analytics to identify valuable customers based on their purchasing behavior. This project is ideal for practicing SQL skills in a real-world business context.

 # Project Objective
- Understand customer purchasing behavior through RFM analysis.
- Apply SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from raw data.
- Build logic that can be adapted for targeting marketing campaigns.

# Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Anish7000/Customer-RFM-Case-study/blob/main/cust%20RFM%20dataset.csv">Dataset</a>

# Question 
- 1. Calculate RFM Scores for Each Customer 
- 2. Top 10 Most Profitable Customers 
- 3. Identify Churned Customers (No purchase in last 180 days)
- 4. Segment Customers Based on Quantile RFM Scoring 
- 5. Bottom 5 Selling Products by Quantit
- 6.  Group Customers by RFM Score into Segments (Champions, At Risk, etc.) 
- 7.  Top 5 products by revenue 
- 8.  Average Spend per Customer 
- 9.  Most frequent purchasing customers (Top 5 by invoice count) 
- 10. Monthly revenue trend 

# SQL queries

# Project Outcome
- Identified loyal customers and high spenders who can be rewarded or targeted for premium campaigns.
- Detected at-risk and churn-prone customers for re-engagement efforts.
- Enabled creation of data-driven marketing segments.
- Demonstrated practical use of SQL for customer analytics.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used for customer segmentation through RFM analysis, a common business scenario in customer relationship management and marketing. Itâ€™s an excellent use case of how data analytics can directly drive business decisions and campaign strategies.
